        <p>Learn how to make 30 Minute Mozzarella, in your own kitchen. With just a few simple ingredients, this step by step recipe will show you how easy and easy it is to make cheese at home. From milk to yum, this recipe is fun for all ages.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Gallon of Milk (not ultra-pasteurized)</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp Citric Acid</li>
            <li>1/4 Rennet Tablet or 1/4 tsp Single Strength Liquid Rennet</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cheese Salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3><strong><li>Prepare Work Area</li></h3></strong>
            <p>Do not prepare any other food while you are making cheese. Put all food products away.

                Move all sponges, cloths and dirty towels away from your work surface, wipe your sink and stove with soap and water. Finally use your antibacterial cleaner to wipe down all surfaces.</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Prepare Rennet</li></h3></strong>
            <p>Crush 1/4 tablet of rennet and dissolve in 1/4 cup of cool non-chlorinated water, or add 1/4 tsp single strength liquid rennet to the water. Set your rennet mixture aside to use later.</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Mix Citric Acid & Milk</li></h3></strong>
            <p>Add 1 1/2 tsp. of citric acid to 1 cup cool water, pour this into your pot. Now, pour cold milk into your pot quickly, to mix well with the citric acid. This will bring the milk to the proper acidity to stretch well later.</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Heat Milk</li></h3></strong>
            <p>Heat the milk slowly to 90°F. As you approach 90°F, you may notice your milk beginning to curdle slightly due to acidity and temp. Note: If you're having problems with milk forming a proper curd, you may need to increase this temp to 95°F or even 100F.</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Add Rennet</li></h3></strong>
            <p>At 90°F, remove the pot from the burner and slowly add your rennet (which you prepared in step one) to the milk. Stir in a top to bottom motion for approx. 30 seconds, then stop. Cover the pot and leave undisturbed for 5 minutes. Check the curd after 5 minutes, it should look like custard, with a clear separation between the curds and whey. If the curd is too soft or the whey is milky, let it set longer, up to 30 more minutes.</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Cut & Cook Curd</li></h3></strong>
            <p>Cut the curds into a 1" checkerboard pattern. Place the pot back on the stove and heat to 105°F while slowly stirring the curds with your ladle (if you will be stretching the curds in a hot water bath, rather than using a microwave, heat to 110°F in this step). Take the pot off the burner and continue stirring slowly for 2-5 minutes. (More time will make a firmer cheese)</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Transfer & Drain Curd</li></h3></strong>
            <p>With a slotted spoon, scoop curds into a colander or microwave safe bowl (if the curd is too soft at this point, let it sit for another minute or so). Once transferred, press the curd gently with your hand, pouring off as much whey as possible. If desired, you can reserve the whey to use later in baking or as a soup stock.</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Heat Curd & Remove Whey</li></h3></strong>
            <p>If in a colander, transfer the curds into a heat safe bowl. Next, microwave the curd for 1 minute. If desired, add 1 tsp of salt to the curds for added flavor. You will notice more whey separation from the curd. Drain off all whey as you did before. Quickly work the cheese with a spoon or your hands until it is cool enough to touch (rubber gloves will help since the cheese is almost too hot to touch at this point). Microwave two more times for 35 seconds each, and repeat the kneading as in the last step to aid in more whey drain off and ensure even heating of the curds. Drain off all of the whey as you go. Note: If you prefer to not use a microwave here is a recipe using a water bath where the curds are heated in hot water</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Knead & Stretch Curd</li></h3></strong>
            <p>Now the fun begins, knead quickly now as you would bread dough. Remove curd from bowl and continue kneading until it is smooth and shiny. Return it to the microwave if needed (if it begins to cool before it's ready to stretch). Add salt near the finish. At this point, if hot enough, the cheese should be soft and pliable enough to stretch, and stretch, and stretch some more (like taffy). This is what makes it Mozzarella We hope you have as much fun with this as we do.</p>
            <h3><strong><li>Eat & Enjoy</li></h3></strong>
            <p>Now knead your cheese back into a big ball until it is smooth and shiny Your Mozzarella is ready as soon as it's cool enough to eat. To cool quickly place it in a bowl of ice water and refrigerate. When cold you can wrap in plastic wrap and it will last for several days, but is best when eaten fresh.</p>
